 * `dgm::Animation::getCurrentFrame` is now deprecated, but kept to not break backward compatibility
	* Ideally, configure cmake with -D ENABLE_LEGACY_ANIMATION=OFF
	* New version of the animation doesn't depend on input animation states and doesn't index into each clip
	* You shall keep the animation states elsewhere and ask the animation for current state name and frame index
	* This makes the code cleaner since the animation object doesn't depend on rendering information

dgm-lib v3.1.0
 * `dgm::Controller::readAnalog` no longer returns negative values for negative axii halves
    * One gamepad could've a negative half on up, second could have it on down, it is easier to handle in client code this way

    * `LoadCallback` now returns `std::expected<T, dgm::Error>` instead of having an inout T parameter
        * Resources no longer have to be default-constructible (yay, RAII), but they have to be movable
        * Two moves are issued per resource load, but that's a price I am willing to pay for RAII
    * `loadResourcesFromDirectory` is no longer recursive because Android NDK is shit

dgm-lib v2.5.0
 * Added `dgm::Error` for having an error type for `std::expected` with built-in stacktrace
 * Added `dgm::TextureAtlas` that can optimize drawcalls by having a single texture for multiple entities (thus these can be put into a single VBO)
 * `sf::err()` is now redirected into `stderr.txt` (after constructor of `dgm::App` was invoked)
    * Previously, it was completely lost, because it pointed to the original std::cerr stream

dgm-lib v2.4.0

    * Also `dgm::Window` is now marked as `final`

 * Fixed `dgm::App::pushState` stopped working properly after pushed state throwed an exception in constructor

dgm-lib v2.3.0
 * Bumped to SFML v2.6.1
 * Added load helpers to `dgm::Utility` that can be used as load callbacks for `dgm::ResourceManager`

	* There is no longer a restriction about not calling pushState from constructor of AppState derivates. It works now!
	* `isTransparent` and `getClearColor` are no longer virtual methods, they are replaced by `dgm::AppStateConfig`
		* `isTransparent` was broken down into `shouldUpdateUnderlyingState` and `shouldDrawUnderlyingState` - first allows you to specify whether input and update methods should be executed for the state under top state. The second does the same for draw method. If multiple states are transparent in this way, the effect is applied recursively
	* `dgm::AppState::restoreFocus` is now replaced with `restoreFocusImpl`. In addition, `loseFocusImpl` has been added. `dgm::AppState` also has a protected member `hasFocus` to test whether the state is currently the top one or not (only top state has focus). That one, one can test if they are updated because the state is on the top or because the currently top state is transparent.
	* `dgm::App::popState` now accepts optional message parameter that is then passed down to `dgm::AppState::restoreStateImpl`
		* It no longer accepts a number of states to pop. Calling multiple pops in one frame is considered as a bug
	* Added documentation for using `dgm::App`
 * Reworked `dgm::Controller`
	* Gamepad deadzones reworked
	* Methods renamed
	* `releaseInput` now affects axii too if you read them via `isInputToggled`

dgm-lib v2.2.5
 * Added const iterator interface to `dgm::DynamicBuffer`
 * Fixed `dgm::Camera` being positioned to a random position upon construction
	* Now it's center is half of the resolution, so it sees a rectangle defined as `[0, 0, width, height]`

dgm-lib v2.2.4
 * Added method `dgm::ResourceManager::getMutable` so the stored resources can be modified if necessary

dgm-lib v2.2.3
 * Added method `dgm::Path<TileNavPoint>::getLength()`
 * `dgm::TileNavmesh::getPath` was marked deprecated
	* `dgm::TileNavmesh::computePath` which returns `std::optional` should be used instead
 * `dgm::WorldNavmesh::getPath` was marked deprecated
	* `dgm::WorldNavmesh::computePath` which returns `std::optional` should be used instead

dgm-lib v2.2.2
 * Added `dgm::DynamicBuffer::isValidIndex` for testing whether there is something at index
 * Added `dgm::DynamicBuffer::at` which either returns `std::reference_wrapper` for item at index or empty `std::optional`
 * Added `dgm::Path::clone` so the paths can be explicitly copied
 * `dgm::Mesh` was turned into templated `dgm::GenericMesh` where the internal data type can be configured by the template

	* Default constructor is marked `[[deprecated]]`
	* Added convenience constructor for cases where data array should be defaulted
	* `move` methods are `constexpr` and `noexcept`
	* `setVoxelSize(const sf::Vector2u&) is `noexcept`

	* Also most of the concrete implementations are now `constexpr`
	* All default constructors are marked `[[deprecated]]`
 * Fixed `dgm::SpatialIndex::clear` being in private interface (now public)

dgm-lib v2.2.1
 * `dgm::DynamicBuffer` and `dgm::StaticBuffer` have method `clone` for explicit copying and are movable and move-assignable
 * Introduced `dgm::SpatialIndex` which acts as a base class for `dgm::SpatialBuffer` and contains only interface for spatial lookup, not the physical storage
	* It also has a `clear` method for removing all items from lookup
 * Fixed signature of `dgm::Rect::getCenter` - it returned a reference to a temporary

dgm-lib v2.2.0
 * Removed `Conversion` class, implementation moved to `Math`
	* `PIOVER180` and `_180OVERPI` are now defined using std::numbers::pi_v
	* `cartesianToPolar` now returns struct `PolarCoords`
	* `polarToCartesian` now accepts struct `PolarCoords`
 * Overhauled `Math` class
	* `vectorSize` renamed to `getSize`
	* `getUnitVector` renamed to `toUnit`
	* `rotateVector` renamed to `getRotated`
	* `dotProduct` renamed to `getDotProduct`
		* Also fixed bad formula for this function
	* `approxEqual` renamed to `isApproxEqual`
	* `radialDifference` renamed to `getRadialDifference`
	* With the exception of `getRadialDifference`, all functions that work with angles by default work with degrees, but this can be changed to radians using a function template so it is optimized during compilation, like `dgm::Math::getRotated<dgm::Math::AngleType::Radians>(...)`
 * `dgm::DynamicBuffer` is now movable
 * `dgm::SpatialBuffer` is now movable
 * `dgm::SpatialBuffe::getOverlapCandidates` is now `const`

 * Fixed `getClosestPointOnLine` returning bad values for most lines

dgm-lib v2.1.1
 * `dgm::Animation` is initialized with a random state when constructed with animation states
	* This way the program doesn't immediately throw an exception when programmer forgets to set some state
 * `UniversalReference` trait can handle implicit conversions
 * Adding bunch of math functions
	* `getClosestPointOnLine` - useful for finding out distance of a point from a line
	* `getIntersection(line, line)` - for finding intersection of two lines
	* `getIntersection(line, circle)` - for finding intersections between a line and a circle
	* `hasIntersection(line, circle)` - faster check whether line intersects a circle
 * `dgm::ResourceManager` now supports unloading resources via `unloadResource` method

	* Added trait called `StaticBufferType`
 * Added class `dgm::DynamicBuffer`

		* Spatially huge items will take longer than tiny ones

	 * Error handling has been revamped:
		* `dgm::GeneralException` renamed to `dgm::Exception`
		* Stacktrace is appended to error message in `dgm::Exception`
		* `dgm::ResourceException`, `dgm::EnvironmentException` and `dgm::ShellExceptions` were removed, because they were not used

		* The class is fully `constexpr` and mostly `noexcept`
	 * `dgm::ResourceManager` has been revamped:
		* It can be used to store almost any kind of resource by providing user callbacks that handle the loading. Only requirement is that the resource needs to be default-constructible.
		* It is completely `noexcept` and `[[nodiscard]]`
		* It properly invokes destructors
		* It no longer depends on `dgm::LoaderInterface` as loading itself is handled by the callbacks
		* It can list all resource ids tied to particular type
		* It no longer prevents two resources of distinct types not be able to have the same ID
 * Minor changes:
	 * Documentation changes:
		* Added documentation for `dgm::JsonLoader`
		* Added documentation on CMake integration
	 * Warning about name shadowing has been turned into error

dgm-lib v1.9.0
 * `dgm::Animation` no longer depends on `sf::Sprite`
	* Use `dgm::Animation::getCurrentFrame()` instead

 * Added dgm::VisionCone object along with collision detection method between cones and circles
	* Supposed to be used for AI vision
 * dgm::AnimationStates now work by their own instead of std::shared_ptr. dgm::ResourceManager returns references to them and dgm::Animation accepts a const reference to use them so it is still possible to reuse the same AnimationStates object between multiple Animation objects without ever making unneeded copies.
